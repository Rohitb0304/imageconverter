# üñºÔ∏è Image Converter & Compressor App

This is a **Streamlit** web application that allows users to **convert images** between various formats and **compress images** by resizing them. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for image conversions and compression, ensuring that users can download their converted or compressed images in a few clicks.

## Features

- **Image Conversion**: Upload images and convert them to different formats, including:
  - PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF.
  
- **Image Compression**: Upload an image and resize it to specific pixel dimensions, resulting in a compressed version of the image.

- **Download Converted Images**: After conversion, users can download a **ZIP file** containing all converted images.

- **Download Compressed Image**: After compression, users can download the compressed image as a **PNG file**.
